# Nugen
## What is it?
Nugen allows you to modify `.nuspec` file right from your command line. You can edit all the fields, add new ones and remove existing ones all from the terminal.

## Why am I making it?
I use `.nuspec` files at work and we use them to version our application and deploy the package using Octopus and Jenkins. For full automation (where the developer does not need to explicitly open the file and change it) there is no easy way to modify these properties besides writing a script to do, so here we are. I hope I can use this with Jenkins too...

Also I'm trying to learn rust and what a great excuse to do so ðŸ˜…

## How it works

    I'll fill this in when as I build out the app
